# Navigation from Low Earth Orbit (PNT21 - Chapter 42) Plots #

This Matlab code produces some of the plots in Chapter 42 of “Position, Navigation, and Timing Technologies in the 21st Century,” Morton, van Diggelen, Parkinson, Spilker, IEEE-Wiley, 2018. 

Chapter 42 is titled, “Navigation from Low Earth Orbit” and is authored by Tyler G. R. Reid, Todd Walter,  Per K. Enge, David Lawrence, H. Stewart Cobb, Greg Gutt,  Michael O’Connor, & David Whelan 

This produces the following plots: 
- Slant range and spreading loss as a function of orbital altitude and user elevation angle.- Satellite mean motion and orbital period as a function of altitude.
- Satellite footprint radius as a function of orbital altitude and elevation angle.

## How to Use ##

‘MAIN.m’ will make the necessary computations and create and save the plots above.
